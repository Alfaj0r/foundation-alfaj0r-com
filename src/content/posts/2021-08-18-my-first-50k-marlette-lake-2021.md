I ran my first 50k! The official result was 6:26:22, but that's just a minor detail in the grand scheme of this story.

I signed up for this race on January 4th. I had been wanting to step up to the Ultra distance for a bit; from reading race reports and starting to follow the action from some of the local running groups it sounded like something that would be up my alley. After signing up for the race, I also signed up for a [20 week training program from Uphill Athlete](https://uphillathlete.com/introtoultrarunning/) that looked challenging but doable. The first day of training was to be March 30th. Until then, my casual running and biking became my base building, with a small motivational boost of having a big goal on the horizon.

Once the formal training kicked off, a few things were key to staying on target: managing effort levels, the time commitment, and everything else that happens while running for a long time.

Up until this year, I was very familiar with the "no pain, no gain" dogma. But while I was ready to toughen up as much as needed, I had also recently been tuning to a newer approach along the lines of working smarter, not harder. This [TED talk about normal people training like world-class athletes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MALsI0mJ09I) by Stephen Seiler made for a great intro to the concept of planning for the bulk of the training volume to be at a relatively easy effort level, and leaving the hard days to be few and far between. Even better, my training plan started with a [Heart Rate Drift](https://uphillathlete.com/heart-rate-drift/) test to establish just exactly where this line was - at a heart rate of about 148bpm for me.\
I followed this approach with great results! Over the weeks, my effort stayed low but my speeds started to improve; while I was properly recovering from long runs, and keeping my chances of injury very low. The biggest regret was not having done this kind of training before.
