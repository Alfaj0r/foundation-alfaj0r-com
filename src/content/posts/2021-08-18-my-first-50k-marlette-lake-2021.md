I ran my first 50k! The official result was 6:26:22, but that's just a minor detail in the grand scheme of this story.

I signed up for this race on January 4th. I had been wanting to step up to the Ultra distance for a bit; from reading race reports and starting to follow the action from some of the local running groups it sounded like something that would be up my alley. After signing up for the race, I also signed up for a [20 week training program from Uphill Athlete](https://uphillathlete.com/introtoultrarunning/) that looked challenging but doable. The first day of training was to be March 30th. Until then, my casual running and biking became my base building, with a small motivational boost.

Once the formal training kicked off, a few things were key to staying on target: managing effort levels, the time commitment, and the "everything else" that happens while running for a long time.

\- zone 2 stuff

\- Time

\- discovering trails, water filtering

Race recap:

\- strategy of pacing, uphills

\- nutrition, bio

\- gear, comfort

\-- saw some runners with poles and curious to try them out sooner or later

Mention the fucking smoke

Final words - signing up for races, goals, joy found during training
